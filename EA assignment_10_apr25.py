# # How would you create a frozen set from set "x"?




# # How would you create a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both set "x" and set "y"?




# # How would you create a new set that contains only the elements that are unique to either set "x" or set "y"?




# # How would you create a new set that contains all the elements from set "x" and set "y", but without any duplicates?




# # How would you create a new set that contains all the elements that are in either set "x" or set "y", but not in both?




# # How would you check if set "x" is disjoint from set "y"?




# # How would you check if set "x" is a proper subset of set "y"?




# # How would you check if set "y" is a proper superset of set "x"?




# # How would you check if set "x" is equal to set "y"?




# # How would you find the maximum element in set "x"?




# # How would you find the minimum element in set "y"?




# # How would you find the sum of all the elements in set "x"?
